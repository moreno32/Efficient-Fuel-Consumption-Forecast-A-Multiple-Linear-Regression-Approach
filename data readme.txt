Project Title: "Efficient Fuel Consumption Forecast: A Multiple Linear Regression Approach"

Overview:
The purpose of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the fuel consumption of new light-duty vehicles in Canada using a Multiple Linear Regression approach. The model will be trained on a fuel consumption dataset, FuelConsumption.csv, which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions. By utilizing the power of multiple linear regression, we aim to improve the efficiency of fuel consumption predictions and reduce the carbon footprint of the transportation sector in Canada.

Motivation:
The transportation sector is a significant contributor to carbon dioxide emissions, which are the leading cause of global warming. By improving the accuracy of fuel consumption predictions, we can help reduce the carbon footprint of the transportation sector and contribute to a more sustainable future. Furthermore, this project provides a valuable learning opportunity to understand the application of multiple linear regression in solving real-world problems.

Learning Objectives:

Import and preprocess the FuelConsumption.csv dataset.
Develop a multiple linear regression model for fuel consumption prediction.
Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics.
Explore the relationship between different variables and their impact on fuel consumption.
Understand the practical applications of multiple linear regression.

Technical Aspect:
In this project, we will use the following technologies:

pandas for data manipulation and analysis
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
numpy and scipy for numerical computing
scikit-learn for machine learning
itertools for generating combinations of variables

Data Source:
The dataset used in this project, FuelConsumption.csv, contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada. This dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from the Government of Canada's Open Data Portal.

Project Structure:

Importing needed packages and downloading the data.
Understanding the data and performing exploratory data analysis.
Building the multiple linear regression model.
Training and evaluating the model.
Making predictions using the trained model.
Exploring the relationship between different variables and fuel consumption.

Credits:
The dataset used in this project was obtained from the Government of Canada's Open Data Portal.
